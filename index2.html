        <p>His face looked like a man's. An older man in his 40s. Plain. Ordinary. I knew him though. I knew the creature that hid behind the mask of a man. And I knew why he was standing in the cold rain, staring in the direction of my window.</p>
        <p>I began to tremble knowing what I had to do...</p>

        <p>I move closer to the window. For a moment, I think I see him there. But A cold emptiness stands where I thought 'he' was. The street is deserted. Wet concrete shining indifferently.

Inhumanly still.</p>
